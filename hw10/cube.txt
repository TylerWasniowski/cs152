What is the effect of r1 r2 on the corners?
    The vertices move (3 5 6), and the faces move (d, f, l, r, u).

...it suffices to show that you can obtain [b,d,f], [b,d,l], [b,d,r], and [b,d,u]. They generate the entire group. Show how these four permutations can be produced from r0 . . . r7 so that the vertices are left unchanged.
    [r1, r7, r2, r4] gives us (b d f) (l r u).
    [r2, r1, r4, r7, r7, r2] gives us (b d l) (f r u).
    [r0, r3, r5, r6, r6, r0] gives us (b d r) (f l u).
    [r0, r0, r5, r5, r6, r3] gives us (b d u) (f l r).
    So (b d f), (b d l), (b d r), and (b d u) are all possible.
